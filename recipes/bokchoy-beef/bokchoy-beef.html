    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe that I came across on reddit. This recipe incorporates bokchoy
        since I wanted to serve this dish on a bowl of rice rather than lettuce.
        I usually use 3-4 normal sized bokchoys or 7-8 baby bokchoys. What I have written
        here is the original recipe, but feel free to substitute ingredients to your liking!
        I've typically substitute half of the beef with tofu and the cashews with peanuts.
        A link to the original recipe can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/n76srh/cashew_chicken_lettuce_wraps/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredient List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup peanuts, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 head butter lettuce, leaves separated</li>
        <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow or white onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp of fresh minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Sriracha, optional</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, hoisin, and sriracha (if using) and set aside. Begin heating a swirl of olive oil over medium high heat in a large skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook the ground beef and diced onion in the skillet until the beef is cooked through, then drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce mixture, garlic, and ginger to the skillet along with the meat and return to medium heat. Let simmer, mixing frequently, for a few more minutes and season to taste with salt and pepper. The mixture should gradually darken in color as it simmers.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and add the cashews and green onion, mix to combine.</li>
        <li>To serve, fill each lettuce leaf with a few tablespoons of the mixture and garnish with sesame seeds.</li>
    </ol>
