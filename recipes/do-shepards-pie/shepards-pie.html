    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>While in my apartment studying at UCI, I wanted to make a shepards pie in a dutch oven so I didn't have to buy a pan exclusively for it. The recipe I used can be found <a href="https://downshiftology.com/recipes/shepherds-pie/">here</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredient List</h2>
        <h3>Potato Topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Meat Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons avocado oil or olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 large carrots, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks, diced</li>
            <li>1½ pounds ground lamb or ground beef</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth, or if using ground beef use beef broth</li>
            <li>1½ tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1½ tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fresh rosemary, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Potato Topping</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the potatoes in a pot on the stove and cover with cold water. Turn the heat to high and bring to a boil. Cook for 13 to 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft when pierced with a fork.</li>
            <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander, then return to the pot. Add the milk, butter, salt and pepper and mash until creamy.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Meat Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). In a large oven-safe saute pan, heat the oil on medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute for a minute. Then add the diced carrots, diced celery, and lamb. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until the meat is browned. Use your spatula to break up the meat while cooking.</li>
            <li>Drain the fat from the pan and add the broth, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper. Simmer for about 5 minutes, until the sauce is slightly thickened.</li>
            <li>Add the frozen peas and stir together. Turn off the stove</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Assembling Pie</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the back of your spatula to flatten the meat mixture into a single layer.</li>
            <li>Dollop the mashed potatoes on top of the meat and use a spoon or spatula to spread it flat to the edges. If desired, create texture in the potato topping with a spoon or fork.</li>
            <li>Bake the shepherd's pie until slightly golden, about 25 to 30 minutes. You can broil the top for 1 to 2 minutes as well.</li>
        </ol>
