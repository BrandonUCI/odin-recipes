    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I started writing this simple HTML website back during the winter break of my 2nd year. The goal was to learn as much web development as I could and to also
        put a project on my resume. By following the Odin Project however, I was redirected and ended up learning fundamentals about what the internet actually is (network of computers via wires),
        how computers interact, what webpages and websites are, and git and linux fundamentals. As a result, I only ended up getting exposure to html. Now that summer has started, I am now
        revisiting this project and refreshing myself with some HTML concepts. After refreshing myself by writing some basic HTML, I will move on to CSS and HTML.</p>
